**51 marks**

See the Anolis Lizards background file for the context of this question.


Of interest is whether the two species of lizard occupy different perch habitats.

Assuming you have downloaded the data files into a directory saved on `dataDirectory` you create `lizards` either as
```{r Anolis lizards read txt data, eval = FALSE}
file <- file.path(dataDirectory, "AnolisLizards.txt")
lizards <- read.table(file, header=TRUE)
```

or as 

```{r Anolis lizards read csv data, eval = TRUE}
file <- file.path(dataDirectory, "AnolisLizards.csv")
lizards <- read.csv(file, header=TRUE)
```

Just set `eval = TRUE` for your preferred choice.




a. The **Problem** stage. 

  i. *(3 marks)* What is the target population here?  What are the units making up the population?
    
The target population is all the species of Anolis lizards present in Bimini,
whose perch habitat is to be studied, in the past, present and future.

The units making up the population is lizards of the different species.

b. The **Plan** stage.

  i. *(3 marks)* What is the study population? What are the units making up the population.
    
The study population is the 4 species of Anolis lizards, sagrei, distichus, 
angusticeps and carolinensis present in Bimini, whose perch habitat is to be 
studied and recorded from November 18 to 30, 1966, between 9:00 A.M. and 
4:30 P.M.

The units making up the population is lizards of the different species.

    
  ii. *(3 marks)*  What are the variates?  Which are response? Which are explanatory? 
    
Variates is the species, perch_height_ft, perch_diameter_inches and count.


Explanatory is the perch diameter and perch height.




  iii. *(3 marks)*  Describe the sampling plan. 
    
    
The sampling plan is Judgement sampling, cause the person recording the species'
perch height and diameter at the Bimini can observe all different types of 
fauna found there. After identifying a Anolis lizard of
a particular species, the perch height and diameter  and count is noted.
    
  iv. *(2 marks)* Describe the measuring system mentioned.
    
    
The measuring system for perch height is feet.
The measuring system for perch diameter is inches.
The count is the count of a particular species spotted.
    
  v. *(2 marks)* Is this study experimental or observational?  Explain your reasoning.
  
  
This study is observational because the data is collected through observations
at the Bimini and recorded from November 18 to 30, 1966, between 9:00 A.M. and 
4:30 P.M.


c. The **Data** stage.

  i.  *(1 mark)* The `lizards` data is a data frame having 8 rows with the counts in one column.  Another way to represent this data is as a $2 \times 2 \times2$ table of counts.  Use the `xtabs()` function with an appropriate formula to construct such a table from `lizards`.  Assign the table to the variable `lizardsTable`. That is complete the following:
    
        ```{r lizardsTable, eval = FALSE}
        lizardsTable <- xtabs(... your arguments here ...)
        ```
        
        Note that `lizardsTable` will not be a `data.frame` but a `table` and an `array`.
```{r}
      lizardsTable <- xtabs(count ~ species +  
                        perch_height_ft + perch_diameter_inches , data=lizards)
      lizardsTable
```
        
  ii.  *(2 marks)* Using `lizardTables` and the `sum` function, programmatically determine how many lizards there were of each species.  Show how the same results can be obtained with `margin.table()`.
```{r}
       sum(lizardsTable[1,1:2,1:2]) #angusticeps
       sum(lizardsTable[2,1:2,1:2]) #sagrei
       margin.table(lizardsTable, "species")

```
d. The **Analysis** stage.

  i. *(10 marks)*  Use `xtabs()` with an appropriate formula on the original `lizards` data frame to construct a smaller table that ignores species and just contains the counts at each perch habitat.  Call this table `lizardsHabitat`.  You will now do a small analysis based only on this table.  That is, 
    
        - Complete the following:
        
        ```{r lizardsHabitat, eval = FALSE}
        lizardsHabitat <- xtabs(... your arguments here ...)
        lizardsHabitat
        ```
        
        - Construct an eikosogram of perch height versus perch diameter using the `lizardsHabitat` table. 
        
        - Call `summary(lizardsHabitat)`.
        
        - Show your code.
        
        Based on all of the above results, what can you conclude about the distribution of the perch of these lizards?
        
        What does this say about the preferred habitat of these lizards?  Explain.
    
```{r}
     lizardsHabitat <- xtabs(count ~   
                        perch_height_ft + perch_diameter_inches, data=lizards)
     lizardsHabitat
     library(eikosograms)
     eikos(perch_diameter_inches ~ perch_height_ft, data = lizardsHabitat, 
      xlab_rot = 45, ispace = list(bottom = 20))
     summary(lizardsHabitat)
```       
The perch height and perch diameter are not independent based on the eikosogram
as there are no flat lines.
p-value of 0.0003817 suggests strong evidence against the hypothesis of 
independence between perch height and perch diameter.

Since perch height and perch diameter are not independent, it means that the
perch height preferred by the lizard is dependent on the perch diameter, this 
could mean that as the perch height increases the perch diameter decreases or
as the perch height increases the perch diameter increases. So the habitat of
the lizard is not completely random and is largely related to the dependent
relationship between perch height and perch diameter.




   ii. *(6 marks)* Repeat the analysis of part (i) above but this time on the sub-table of `lizardsTable` (i.e. no `xtabs()` call) of only the counts for `sagrei`.  In addition to calling `summary()`, also call `chisq.test()` on the relevant table **but** use a significance level determined by simulation.
    
```{r}
       (lizardsTable_sagrei <- lizardsTable[2,1:2,1:2])
       summary(lizardsTable_sagrei)
       chisq.test(lizardsTable_sagrei, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```
        
        
  iii. *(6 marks)* Construct the sub-table of `lizardsTable` (i.e. no `xtabs()` call) containing only the counts for `angusticeps`. Using this table, construct the eikosogram of perch height versus perch diameter.  Also call `chisq.test()` on this table with a significance level determined by simulation. 
    
         - Do the interpretations from the eikosogram and the chi-squared tests agree?  How do they agree/disagree?
         
         - Explain why this has occurred here.
```{r}
       (lizardsTable_angusticeps <- lizardsTable[1,1:2,1:2])
       eikos(perch_diameter_inches ~ perch_height_ft, 
             data = lizardsTable_angusticeps,
       xlab_rot = 45, ispace = list(bottom = 20))
       chisq.test(lizardsTable_angusticeps, simulate.p.value = TRUE)

```         
The interpretations from the eikosogram and the chi-squared tests agree. The
eikosogram says perch diameter and perch height are not independent because
there is no flat line, the chi-squared tests has a p-value of 0.08246 which 
means there is strong evidence against the hypothesis of independence between 
perch diameter and perch height.


This has occured because perch height and perch diameter are dependent on each
other.



  iv. *(4 marks)* Construct the sub-table of `lizardsTable` (i.e. no `xtabs()` call) containing only the counts for lizards on perches that are less than 4.25 inches in diameter.  Using this table, construct the eikosogram of perch height versus species.  Also call `chisq.test()` on this table with a significance level determined by simulation. 
    
         What do you conclude, if anything, about the preference in habitat for the two species?  Justify your conclusions.
         
```{r}
      (lizardsTable_diameter <- lizardsTable[1:2,1:2,1])
      eikos(species ~ perch_height_ft, data = lizardsTable_diameter,
      xlab_rot = 45, ispace = list(bottom = 20))
      chisq.test(lizardsTable_diameter, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```
Based on the eikosogram and the chi-square tests, the perch height and species
are not independent of each other. The eikosogram has no flat lines indicating
there is no independence between perch height and the two species, the 
chi-square test produces a p-value of 0.0004998 which is very small and it means
there is strong evidence against the hypothesis of independence between 
perch height and the two species.
Majority sagrei prefer perch height "< 3" while majority angusticeps prefer
perch height ">=3".


  iv. *(4 marks)* Construct the sub-table of `lizardsTable` (i.e. no `xtabs()` call) containing only the counts for lizards on perches that are three feet or higher in height.  Using this table, construct the eikosogram of perch diameter versus species.  Also call `chisq.test()` on this table with a significance level determined by simulation. 
    
```{r}
      (lizardsTable_height <- lizardsTable[1:2,2,1:2])
      eikos(species ~ perch_diameter_inches, data = lizardsTable_height,
       xlab_rot = 45, ispace = list(bottom = 20))
      chisq.test(lizardsTable_height, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```
Based on the eikosogram and the chi-square tests, the perch diameter and species
are not independent of each other. The eikosogram has no flat lines indicating
there is no independence between perch diameter and the two species, the 
chi-square test produces a p-value of 0.0004998 which is very small and it means
there is strong evidence against the hypothesis of independence between 
perch diameter and the two species.
Majority sagrei prefer perch diameter "> 4.25" while majority angusticeps prefer
perch diameter "<=4.25".         


e. The **Conclusions** stage:

  i. *(2 marks)*  A common name for *anolis angusticeps* is the *Cuban Twig Anole*.  In light of your analysis explain why, or why not, this name might have become common? 
    
Since majority angusticeps prefer perch diameter "<=4.25" and perch height ">=3" 
, the structure of a twig has similar measurements. If majority of angusticeps
are found preferring Cuban Twig as their habitat due to its characteristics, 
*Cuban Twig Anole* could have become a common name for *anolis angusticeps*.
