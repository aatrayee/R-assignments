Consider a study population $\pop{P}_{Study}$ consisting of $N = 100$ blocks labelled $u = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100$.
```{r the blocks, out.width= "75%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(path_concat(imageDirectory, 
#                                    "blocks.png"))
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
```

The blocks are of uniform thickness and density (all blocks were cut from the same opaque plastic sheet of about 5 mm thickness), but have different shapes such as those shown below:

Note that all shapes are convex.

Data on this population of 100 blocks are available as an \R data set `blocks` available in the package \pkg{loon.data}.
To access it you need to have first installed \pkg{loon.data} from CRAN.  If you haven't already done so, this can be installed in \R as
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("loon.data")  # You will only ever have to do this once.
```

Once installed, the `blocks` data is loaded as follows:
```{r}
library(loon.data) 
data("blocks", package = "loon.data")
head(blocks, n = 3)
```

This `blocks` data set has four variates: block `id` number, `weight` in grams, `perimeter` in centimetres, and the `group` of the block (being either `A` or `B`).

In this question, you will examine different possible attributes of interest for this population.

\newpage

a.  Simple numerical attributes.

    i. *(1 mark)* Summarize this population by the following attributes on  the variates `weight` and `perimeter`: the population median, mean, and standard deviation (here computed using `sd()` with denominator $N-1$).
    
       Weight:
    ```{r} 
        medianWeight <- median(blocks$weight)
        meanWeight <- mean(blocks$weight)
        sdWeight <- sd(blocks$weight)
    
        library(knitr)
        popAttributesWeight <- data.frame(median = medianWeight, 
                                      mean = meanWeight, sd = sdWeight)
        kable(popAttributesWeight)
    ```
        Perimeter:
    ```{r}
        medianPerimeter <- median(blocks$perimeter)
        meanPerimeter <- mean(blocks$perimeter)
        sdPerimeter <- sd(blocks$perimeter)
       
        popAttributesPerimeter <- data.frame(median = medianPerimeter,
                                            mean = meanPerimeter, sd = sdPerimeter)
        kable(popAttributesPerimeter)
    ```


    ii. *(2 marks)* Repeat the above summaries but now conditional on the group to which each block belongs.  Now include the number in each group.
         Weight for block with group A:
    ```{r} 
         blocks_A <- blocks[blocks$group == "A",]
         medianWeight_A <- median(blocks_A$weight )
         meanWeight_A <- mean(blocks_A$weight)
         sdWeight_A <- sd(blocks_A$weight)
    
         popAttributesWeight_A <- data.frame(median = medianWeight_A, 
                                        mean = meanWeight_A, sd = sdWeight_A)
         kable(popAttributesWeight_A)
    ```

         Weight for block with group B:
    ```{r}
         blocks_B <- blocks[blocks$group == "B",]
         medianWeight_B <- median(blocks_B$weight )
         meanWeight_B <- mean(blocks_B$weight)
         sdWeight_B <- sd(blocks_B$weight)
    
         popAttributesWeight_B <- data.frame(median = medianWeight_B, 
                                        mean = meanWeight_B, sd = sdWeight_B)
         kable(popAttributesWeight_B)
    ```
    
        Perimeter for block with group A:
    ```{r}
         medianPerimeter_A <- median(blocks_A$perimeter)
         meanPerimeter_A <- mean(blocks_A$perimeter)
         sdPerimeter_A <- sd(blocks_A$perimeter)
    
         popAttributesPerimeter_A <- data.frame(median = medianPerimeter_A,
                                           mean = meanPerimeter_A, sd = sdPerimeter_A)
         kable(popAttributesPerimeter_A)

    ```

        Perimeter for block with group B:
    ```{r}
         medianPerimeter_B <- median(blocks_B$perimeter)
         meanPerimeter_B <- mean(blocks_B$perimeter)
         sdPerimeter_B <- sd(blocks_B$perimeter)
    
         popAttributesPerimeter_B <- data.frame(median = medianPerimeter_B, 
                                           mean = meanPerimeter_B, sd = sdPerimeter_B)
         kable(popAttributesPerimeter_B)

    ```

    iii. *(3 marks)* On the basis of the above computed attributes, describe how each group differs from the whole population and from each other.
         
         The median and mean weight of blocks with group A are smaller than the whole population and blocks with group B by approximately 10 grams and 20 grams respectively. This means that blocks with group A tend to have smaller weights.
         The median and mean perimeter of blocks with group A are smaller than the whole population and blocks with group B by approximately 4 grams and 8 centimeters respectively. This means that blocks with group A tend to be smaller in size.
         
         The median and mean weight of blocks with group B are larger than the whole population  and blocks with group A by approximately 10 grams and 20 grams respectively. This means that blocks with group B tend to have heavier weights.
         The median and mean perimeter of blocks with group B are larger than the whole population and blocks with group A by approximately 4 grams and 8 centimeters respectively. This means that blocks with group B tend to be larger in size.
         Group A contains blocks are that are lighter and smaller while Group B contains blocks that are heavier and larger. The average of the whole population considers both groups A and B, hence the average and median of the whole population lies in between the values of both the groups.
         

b. Simple graphical attributes.

    i. *(8 marks)* Draw (suitably labelled) histograms of the weight for the whole population, only the blocks in group `A`, and only the blocks in group `B`. 
       Make sure you use
       
       - the same `xlim = extendrange(blocks$weight)`, 
       - the same `ylim = c(0,20)`,  and 
       - the same `breaks <- seq(min(xlim), max(xlim), length.out = 20)` 
       
       in all histograms.  
       
       Add a vertical dashed red line at the average of the blocks in each case.  
       
       Arrange the three plots so that they appear above one another in your display.
    
       Comment on the differences between histograms.
    
       Show your code.
       
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
        xlim <- extendrange(blocks$weight)
        ylim <- c(0,20)
        breaks <- seq(min(xlim), max(xlim), length.out = 20)
        savePar <- par(mfrow = c(3,1))
        hist(blocks$weight, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, breaks = breaks,
            main = "Distribution of weights from whole population", xlab = "weights")
        abline(v = meanWeight, col = "red", lty = 3, lwd = 5)
       
       
        hist(blocks_A$weight, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, breaks = breaks,
            main = "Distribution of weights from blocks in group A", xlab = "weights")
        abline(v = meanWeight_A, col = "red", lty = 3, lwd = 5)
       
        hist(blocks_B$weight, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, breaks = breaks,
            main = "Distribution of weights from blocks in group B", xlab = "weights")
        abline(v = meanWeight_B, col = "red", lty = 3, lwd = 5)
       
        par(savePar)
    ```
     
        From the histograms we can see that the weights of blocks in group A
        range from 10 to approximately 40 and the average is approximately 20
        and the range is small. 
        The weight of blocks in group B are more spread
        out and the smallest weight is greater than the average of group A
        weight. The range of group B weights is larger.
        The histogram of the weights of the entire population is a combination
        of all weights of blocks in both groups A and B.
        
        
    ii. *(6 marks)* Using formula notation (e.g., `boxplot(weight ~ group, data = blocks, ...)`) draw pairs of (suitably labelled) boxplots comparing the two groups:
        
        - first with respect to  block weights and 
        - then with respect to the perimeters.  
        
        Comment on how the two groups compare.
    
        Show your code.
        
        
        
        Weight:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
         boxplot(weight ~ group, data = blocks, main="Weights for Groups A and B",
                ylab="Weights")
    ```
    
        Perimeter:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE}    
         boxplot(perimeter ~ group, data = blocks, main="Perimeters for Groups A and B",
                ylab="perimeter")
    ```
        
     
        From the boxplots we see that the weight and perimeter of blocks in group A 
        are smaller compared to blocks in group B. The range of weight and perimeter
        of group A is small compared to the range of weight and perimeter of group B.
