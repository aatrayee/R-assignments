**28 marks**

See the lizards (artificial) background file for context.

The data are available as `lizards` from the \pkg{loon.data} package:
```{r}
data("lizards", package = "loon.data")
```

Note again that these data are **not real**.

a. **(7 marks)**  On `sex` and `species`.

   i. *(2 marks)* Produce a histogram of the sex counts faceted by species.
      
      The resulting faceted display should 
      
      - have as many facets as there are species
      - show the corresponding histogram of sex in each facet
      - have linking group `"lizards"`
      - be assigned to the variable `h_sex_by_species`
   
      Show your code.
      
      Show the resulting faceted plot.
```{r}      
      h_lizard <- l_hist(lizards$sex, showFactors = TRUE,  
                         showScales = TRUE,
                  xlabel = "sex count", title = "Lizard sex counts",
                  linkingGroup = "lizards" )
      h_sex_by_species <- l_facet(h_lizard, by = lizards$species)
      plot(h_sex_by_species)

```
   i. *(2 marks)* What differences, if any, do you see in the sex distributions?
   
   In species "A" and "C", the count of females is lesser than the count of 
   males, while in species "B" and "D", the count of females is greater than
   the count of males.
    
   i. *(3 marks)*  Formally test the hypothesis that `sex` and `species` are
      independently distributed.  What conclusions do you draw?
      
      Show your code and its results.
```{r}      
      library(eikosograms)
      sex_species <- xtabs(~ species + sex , data = lizards)
      eikos(species ~ sex, data = sex_species,
      xlab_rot = 45, ispace = list(bottom = 20))
      chisq.test(sex_species)
      
```
The flat lines across the vertical bars suggests evidence for the hypothesis 
that sex is independent of species. The chi-squared produces a p-value of 
0.2272 which is quite large and it suggests that there is little to no evidence
against the hypothesis that sex is independent of species.

      

b. **(10 marks)**  On perch preferences.

   i. *(2 marks)* Construct an interactive histogram of the `perchHeight`.
   
      Show your code and the resulting plot.
      
      The histogram must 
      
      - have `linkingGroup = "lizards"`
      - be assigned to the variable `h_height`
      
```{r}
      h_height <- l_hist(lizards$perchHeight,   
                         showScales = TRUE,
                 xlabel = "perchHeight", title = "perchHeight",
                  linkingGroup = "lizards" )

      plot(h_height)
```
      
   i. *(2 marks)* Construct an interactive histogram of the `perchDiameter`.
   
      Show your code and the resulting plot.
      
      The histogram must 
      
      - have `linkingGroup = "lizards"`
      - be assigned to the variable `h_diameter`
      
```{r}
      h_diameter <- l_hist(lizards$perchDiameter,  
                         showScales = TRUE,
                  xlabel = "perchDiameter", title = "perchDiameter",
                  linkingGroup = "lizards" )
      plot(h_diameter)
```
      
   i. *(2 marks)* Brush the `perchHeight` histogram `h_height` and observe
      the effect on the `perchDiameter` histogram `h_diameter`.
      
      Describe the relationship you observe, if any, between `perchHeight` and `perchDiameter`.
      
      Does this make sense?

The values towards the left of the histogram of perchHeight is related to the 
values towards the right of the histogram of perchDiameter, i.e., the lower
values of perchHeight is related to higher values of perchDiameter and vice
versa.
Yes, it makes sense because for a typical structure of a branch, as the height 
increases, the diameter of the branch becomes smaller.

      
     
   i. *(1 mark)* Brush the `perchHeight` histogram `h_height` and observe
      the effect on the faceted display of `sex` by `species`.
      
      What does this suggest?
      
As perchHeight increases, the faceted display of `sex` by `species` increases
from left to right starting from female to male in the order of species A,B,C,D.
This suggests the species A prefers a smaller perchHeight compared to species B,
B prefers a smaller perchHeight compared to species C, C prefers a smaller 
perchHeight compared to species D, in general for all species females prefer
smaller perchHeight than males
         

   i. *(2 marks)* Facet the `perchHeight` histogram `h_height` by `sex`.
      
      The faceting should  
      
      - created with `layout = "wrap"`
      - be by `sex`
      - be arranged in a single column
      - assigned to `h_height_by_sex`
      
      Show your code.
      
      Show the resulting plot.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
      h_height_by_sex <- l_facet(h_height, by = lizards$sex, layout = "wrap", 
      ncol=1)
      plot(h_height_by_sex)
```
      
   i. *(1 mark)* Which sex appears most likely to be found at the highest perch heights?
   
   
   Male
   
      
c. **(11 marks)**  On the relationship between perch diameter and perch height.

   i. *(3 marks)* Fit a straight line model `perchDiameter ~ perchHeight` to the lizards data.
   
      Write down the equation of the fitted line.
      
      Does this make sense? Explain.
      
      Do **not** show your code.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fit1 <- lm(perchDiameter ~ perchHeight,
data = lizards)
fit1
```
Here \[\hat{\alpha} = 4.6374\] is the intercept and \[\hat{\beta} =  -0.5109\]
is the slope
\[ \hat{\mu}(x) = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}x\]
\[ \hat{\mu}(x) = 4.6374  + -0.5109x\] is the equation of the fitted line.



Yes, the equation makes sense because it shows that the slope is negative,
which suggests that perch Diameter and perch Height are inversely proportional
and this has been seen while analysing the histograms for perch Diameter and 
perch Height.


   i. *(2 marks)* Draw an interactive scatterplot with `x = perchHeight` and
      `y = perchDiameter`.
      
      The plot should 
      
      - have linking group `"lizards"
      - be assigned to the variable `p_perch`
      
      Show your code and the resulting plot.
      
```{r}
      p_perch <- l_plot(lizards$perchHeight, lizards$perchDiameter,
      linkingGroup = "lizards")
      plot(p_perch)
```
      
   i. *(1 mark)* On the basis of the above plot **alone**, write a one sentence summary of the relationship between the perch height and the perch diameter, at least as preferred by these (fictitious) lizards.
   
   The perch height and the perch diameter are inversely proportional to one 
   another.
   
    
   i. *(1 mark)* Colour the `p_perch` scatterplot by `species`.
   
      Show your code and the resulting plot.
```{r}
      p_perch["color"] <- lizards$species
      plot(p_perch)

```
      
   i. *(2 marks)* On the basis of the above coloured `p_perch` scatterplot, what do you conclude about the perch preferences of these (fictitious) lizards? 
   
   
   Species A (green) prefers highest perch diameter and lowest perch height,
   Species B (pink) prefers perch diameter lesser than that preferred by Species
   A and higher perch height than that preferred by Species A.
   Species C (grey) prefer perch diameter lesser than that preferred by Species
   A and B, and higher perch height than that preferred by Species A and B. 
   Species D (blue) prefers the lowest perch diameter compared to Species A, B 
   and C and highest perch height compared to Species A, B and C.
   
   
   i. *(2 marks)* By interacting with the plots as you see fit, investigate the relationship between perch diameter and height **only** for female lizards from species "D".
   
      Describe how these lizards prefer their perch as well as the relationship between perch diameter and height for these lizards.
      
      
      
They prefer a high perch height and lesser perch diameter. 
For lower perch diameter, the height is the highest and as perch diameter 
increases, the height decreases.
