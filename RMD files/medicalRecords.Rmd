**40 marks**


The scientific context for this question can be found in the "MedicalRecordsContext" file.
All questions should be answered with respect to this context.
\footnotesize 
(**Note:** This is an entirely fictional data set created by R.W. Oldford.)

\normalsize

a. **(3 marks)** Populations and sample 

   i. *(1 mark)* What is the target population here?  
   
Patients treated with treatment A or B in all countries of the world, in the
past, present and future.

   i. *(1 mark)* What is the study population? 
   
Patients treated with treatment A or B with Electronic medical records 
available.

   i. *(1 mark)* What is the sample? 
   
3200 patients where 1600 patients are treated with treatment A and 1600 patients
are treated with treatment B and the number of males and females is both 1600.
    

In the following questions, **all** code  **must** be written using \pkg{magrittr} pipes in combination with functions from \pkg{dplyr} or others from the \pkg{tidyverse}.

To compare treatments, in each part you need to determine the proportion of patients who recovered for each treatment.

\newpage

b. **(10 marks)**  The analysis will begin by comparing the recovery rates of the treatments ignoring the sex and age of the patients.

   i. *(4 marks)*  Beginning with `medicalRecords %>%`, form a pipeline which will produce a data set having 
   two variables, `Treatment` and `recoveryRate`  (in that order), which shows the **percentage** of **all** 
   patients (ignoring sex and age) who recovered from each treatment.
   
      - Save this data as the value of `medRecovery`
      
      - Show your code and the result `medRecovery`.
      

```{r}
      library(magrittr)
      medicalRecords %>%
      select(Treatment, Outcome, Freq) %>%
      aggregate(. ~ Treatment + Outcome, 
      data = .,
      FUN = . %>% sum %>% divide_by(1600) %>% multiply_by(100)) %>%
      transform(recoveryRate =Freq, Freq=NULL ) %>%
      filter(Outcome=="Recovered")     %>%
      transform(Outcome = NULL)-> medRecovery
      medRecovery
```

   i. *(5 marks)*  Using the dataset `medRecovery` just created, produce a `ggplot` that has 
   
      - `Treatment` on the horizontal axis, `recoveryRate` on the vertical axis, 
      - a point of size 5 at the different values of `(Treatment, recoveryRate)`
      - a line connecting the above two points (**hint:** an aesthetic of `group = 1` is required to make this work)
      - vertical limits between 0 and 100
      - suitable title and axis labels
      
      Show your code and the resulting `ggplot`
```{r}
     ggplot(data = medRecovery, mapping = aes(x = Treatment, y = recoveryRate))+
     geom_point(size = 5) +
     geom_line(aes(group = 1))+
     ylim(0, 100) +
     ggtitle("Recovery rate of Treatments (A and B)")+
     xlab("Treatment") +
     ylab("Recovery Rate (%)")

```
      
   i. *(1 mark)*  On the basis of these results, which treatment would you recommend for this disease, `A` or `B`?

Treatment A, because the percentage of recovery rate in treatment A in higher 
than treatment B

\newpage

c. **(8 marks)**  Objections are raised that the previous analysis did not distinguish between the sexes.  It might be, for example, that the female physiology reacts different than does the male one.
   
   i. *(4 marks)* Again, beginning with `medicalRecords %>%`, now
      form a pipeline which will produce a data set having 
      two variables, `Treatment` and `recoveryRate`  (in that order), which shows the **percentage** of **female** 
      patients (ignoring age) who recovered from each treatment. 
      
      - Save this data as the value of `medRecoveryFemale`.

      - Using `medRecoveryFemale` produce a ``ggplot` just as was done for all patients before but now only for females.  
      
      - **Do not** show the code for your ggplot construction.  Just the plot itself.
      
      - **Do** show your pipeline code that constructs the `medRecoveryFemale`, and print `medRecoveryFemale`


```{r}
      medicalRecords %>%
      select(Treatment, Sex, Outcome, Freq) %>%
      filter(Sex=="Female")     %>%
      aggregate(. ~ Treatment + Outcome+ Sex, 
      data = .,
      FUN = . %>% sum) %>% 
      transform(recoveryRate1 =Freq,  Freq=NULL) %>% 
      mutate(recoveryRate = if_else(Treatment=="A", 
                                    (recoveryRate1/1200)*100, 
                                    (recoveryRate1/400)*100)) %>%
      filter(Outcome=="Recovered")     %>%
      transform(recoveryRate1 =NULL,  Outcome=NULL, Sex=NULL)->medRecoveryFemale 
      medRecoveryFemale
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
     ggplot(data = medRecoveryFemale, mapping = aes(x = Treatment, y = recoveryRate))+
     geom_point(size = 5) +
     geom_line(aes(group = 1))+
     ylim(0, 100) +
     ggtitle("Recovery rate of Females for Treatments (A and B)")+
     xlab("Treatment") +
     ylab("Recovery Rate of Females (%)")

```   
      - On the basis of these results, would you make the same recommendation for females as you did before when you ignored the patient sex?  Why, or why not?
      
No, based on these results I would recommend treatment B, because the
recovery rate for Treatment B in females is more than treatment A. This suggests
that treatment B is more effective in females.
      
   i. *(3 marks)* Repeat the previous part, but now for male patients only, saving the results as `medRecoveryMale`
   
      - Show your code and results
```{r}
      medicalRecords %>%
      select(Treatment, Sex, Outcome, Freq) %>%
      filter(Sex=="Male")     %>%
      aggregate(. ~ Treatment + Outcome+ Sex, 
      data = .,
      FUN = . %>% sum) %>%
      transform(recoveryRate1 =Freq,  Freq=NULL) %>% 
      mutate(recoveryRate = if_else(Treatment=="A", 
                                    (recoveryRate1/400)*100,
                                    (recoveryRate1/1200)*100)) %>%
      filter(Outcome=="Recovered")     %>%
      transform(recoveryRate1 =NULL,  Outcome=NULL, Sex=NULL) -> medRecoveryMale 
      medRecoveryMale
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
     ggplot(data = medRecoveryMale, mapping = aes(x = Treatment, y = recoveryRate))+
     geom_point(size = 5) +
     geom_line(aes(group = 1))+
     ylim(0, 100) +
     ggtitle("Recovery rate of Males for Treatments (A and B)")+
     xlab("Treatment") +
     ylab("Recovery Rate of Males (%)")

```   

 - On the basis of these results, would you make the same recommendation for males as you did before when you ignored the patient sex?  Why, or why not?
      
No, based on these results I would recommend treatment B, because the
recovery rate for Treatment B in males is more than treatment A. This suggests
that treatment B is more effective in males
   
   i. *(1 mark)* Based on all analyses so far, if the patient's sex were unknown at the time treatment had to be given, which would you recommend?  Why?
   
Treatment A. If the patient's sex is unknown, the recovery rate for treatment A
has a higher value, this suggests regardless of sex, treatment A is more 
effective.

\newpage

d. **(12 marks)**  Objections are now raised that all previous analysis failed to account for possible differences in age as well as sex.  Older people might have different reactions than younger, and that too might depend upon their sex.

   i. *(5 marks)* Again, beginning with `medicalRecords %>%`, 
      form a pipeline which will produce a **single** data set having 
      four variables, `Age`, `Sex`, `Treatment` and `recoveryRate`  (in that order), which shows the **percentage** of
      patients (of every age and sex group) who recovered from each treatment.
      
      - Save the result as `medRecoveryAll`
      
      - Show your code and the value of `medRecoveryAll`
```{r}
      medicalRecords %>%
      select(Age, Sex, Treatment, Outcome, Freq) %>%
      aggregate(. ~ Treatment + Outcome+ Sex + Age, 
      data = .,
      FUN = . %>% sum)  %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from = Outcome,
      values_from = Freq) %>%
      transform(recoveryRate = Recovered/(Died+Recovered)*100, Died=NULL,
                Recovered= NULL) %>%
      extract(, c("Age", "Sex", "Treatment","recoveryRate"))-> medRecoveryAll 
      medRecoveryAll
```      
   i. *(4 marks)* Using `medRecoveryAll`, produce a facetted `ggplot` which
   
      - shows a point of size 5 for every combination of `(Treatment, recoveryRate)`
      - has a line connecting the two treatments for each group
      - is grouped by `Age`
      - is coloured by `Age`
      - is facetted by `Sex`
      - has vertical limits from 0 to 100
      - has suitable title and labels
      
      Show your code and your plot
```{r}
      ggplot(data = medRecoveryAll
             , mapping = aes(x = Treatment,
                             y = recoveryRate, 
                             group = Age, colour = Age)) +
      geom_line(lwd = 1.5) + geom_point(size = 5) + ylim(0,100)+
      facet_wrap(~ Sex,) + ggtitle("Recovery rate of Treatments (A and B)")+
      xlab("Treatment") +
      ylab("Recovery Rate (%)")
```

   i. *(1 mark)*  What do you conclude about each of the following (and why)?
     
      - the recovery rates of males versus females
      
The recovery rate for both treatments is higher in females compared to
males as can be seen in the above plot. This could mean that both the treatments
work better on females compared to males.
     
      - the recovery rates of young versus old
      
The recovery rates in the young is higher than the recovery rates in old in both
females and males. This might be because the young reacts better to both 
treatments and recovers better compared to the old.
     
   i. *(2 marks)*  Based on this more detailed analysis, which treatment would you now recommend? Would this change if you did not know the age group of the patient?
   
I would recommend treatment A, because the recovery rate for treatment A is 
higher in both male and female and also both age groups.


Even if the age group of the patient was not known, treatment A would still
be recommended because the recovery rate of treatment A is higher than 
treatment B even if age group is not considered.
   
\newpage

e. **(5 marks)** Instead of using pipelines, a multi-way *contingency* table can be constructed using `xtabs()` and the results plotted using `eikos()` from the \pkg{eikosograms} package.

   i. *(2 marks)* Use `xtabs()` to construct the $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$ table of counts for all combinations of `Age`, `Sex`, `Treatment`, and `Outcome`.
      
      - save the result as `medRecordsTable`
      
      - Show your code
      
      - **Do not** show the resulting table, but **do show** its `dimnames()` and its `sum()`
```{r}
      medicalRecords %>%
      xtabs(Freq ~ Age + Sex +Treatment+Outcome, data=.) -> medRecordsTable
      medRecordsTable %>% dimnames() #dimnames
      medRecordsTable %>% sum() #sum
```
   
   i. *(3 marks)* Using the multi-way table `medRecordsTable`, complete the following \R `chunk` using the `RMarkdown` parameters (e.g. `fig.width`, etc.) appearing in the  \R `chunk` header (of course remove or change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE`) to show an eikosogram having 
   
      - `Outcome` as response and
      - `Treatment`, `Sex`, and `Age` (in that order) as explanatory variates.
    
      ```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height=4 , out.height = "50%"}
        eikos(...,   # <- complete this part
              main = "Proportionate treatment outcomes",
              xlab_rot = 45, xvals_size = 8, lock_aspect = FALSE)
      ```
      
      - Show your completed code.
```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height=4 , out.height = "50%"}
      eikos(Outcome ~ Treatment + Sex + Age, data=medRecordsTable,   
              main = "Proportionate treatment outcomes",
              xlab_rot = 45, xvals_size = 8, lock_aspect = FALSE)
```
      - Which treatments are now suggested for each of the four groups: Young women, older women, young men, older men?
      
      
      Young women - Treatment A
      
      Older women - Treatment A
      
      Young men - Treatment A
      
      Older men - Treatment A
  
\newpage      
   
f. **(2 marks)** The **Conclusions** stage.

 i. *(1 mark)* Is it possible that a fourth (after `Treatment`, `Age`, and `Sex`) binary variate could be found which would reverse which treatment had the higher recovery rate?  Or not?
    
The fourth binary variate could be if the vaccine was taken or not. Lets assume
that if the vaccine was taken and people still contracted the virus, treatment
B had better results. So if most people are vaccinated but still get the virus
and they are given treatment B, the recovery rate would be higher for treatment
B compared to treatment A.
    
   ii. *(1 mark)*  What two principal recommendations would you have the health scientists undertake in the future to ensure that more reliable conclusions might be drawn about which treatment is superior?

1) Have age groups in multiples of 5, for example: 20-25, 25-30, 30-35 to 
better understand how the treatments affect these age groups instead of having
a big age group like 20-39.

2) Check if the patients have any underlying diseases to understand the impact
of the treatment better.
